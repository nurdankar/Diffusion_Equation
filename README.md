# Diffusion_Equation
We solve the one- and two-dimensional diffusion equations in two different coding forms. In the first form, we use very basic terms to grasp terminology. We then take this one step further and use Python functions to describe the problem, since this allows us to code more complex mathematical models in a useful way.
